# Unleash Home Assistant with JS

This TypeScript project is dedicated to JavaScript enthusiasts who want to add superpowers to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), a renowned open-source platform for home automation that provides a centralized hub for managing various smart devices.

## Installation

**/!\ this project use bun, and is not tested with Deno or node.js**

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fullstackbeaver/jsPowerForHA.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ```bash
   cd jsPowerForHA
   ```

3. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

4. Create a .env file based on .env sample file. Fill only needed value

## Usage

Use [this project](https://github.com/fullstackbeaver/ha-config-generator) to generate the entity file configuration.

As you can notice there is no main branch because it is not ready for production : tests are missings.

To start in development mode, run this command in your terminal:
```bash
bun watch
```

## What can it actually do?

It can:
- Interact with Home Assistant's WebSocket
- Interact with Home Assistant through MQTT
- Handle lights, switches, and covers
- Control devices connected to a DMX output through the ArtNet protocol

Lights are dimmed softly with transition.
Covers give position to home assistant when there are moving.

## Customize to Your Needs

This project is designed for my personal use, where lights and switches (and covers behind the switches) are connected to a DMX controller. However, it can be easily adapted to your needs.

The structure follows a hexagonal architecture: business rules are in the core (where all entities are defined), and all external connections are managed in the infrastructure layer. The `state` file in the adapters folder contains helpers to adjust data between this software and Home Assistant. You can easily add or modify connectors and entities.

## Roadmap

- [x] Functional proof of concept that interacts with Home Assistant through WebSocket (and potentially MQTT)
- [ ] Upgrade covers: currently based on duration, but aiming for a smarter solution
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Add tests (work in progress)
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Implement auto-dimming lights based on sensor luminosity levels
- [ ] Add a "mode" or "scenario" feature
- [ ] Convert the project into a Home Assistant plugin
- [ ] Refactor structure: move ports and handlers into modules
